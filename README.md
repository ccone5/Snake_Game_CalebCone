Source URL : https://www.pygame.org/project/3314


The goal of this snake game is to improve upon the previously created snake game by Chuyang Liu. I will be adding on more features and optimizing the game entirely to the best of my abilities. Changes may include a timer option, background music, possibly interactive mode, etc. Overall, I hope to put forth a decent game that anyone can just enjoy in their downtime.
